# Mvlli's-Scary-Games
🎮 Welcome to MVLLI's Horror Indie Games Collection! 👻 
                                                  
Get ready to immerse yourself in a world of creepy experiences. Inside this folder, you'll find a handpicked selection of indie horror games that will keep you on the edge of your seat (or you might just be knocked the hell out on the couch/bed due to tiredness or boredom). Don't worry, I've already given these files a thorough check for any unwanted surprises (I'm a cybersecurity analyst- remember that – all safe and sound!).  

Once you've extracted the zipped or rar folders, simply run the setup and game file as an administrator to ensure a smooth scarefest. Prepare to embark on a journey that will test your nerves and tickle your imagination. 🕯️🔦🕹️ (Repo is subject to games being added, stay put!).


Yours truly,
